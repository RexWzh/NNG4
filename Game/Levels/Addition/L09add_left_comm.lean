Introduction
"
`add_comm a b` is a proof that `a + b = b + a`. But if your goal
is `a + (b + c) = b + (a + c)` then `rw [add_comm a b]` will not
work, because nowhere in this goal is there an `a + b`. Although
it's harder to see,`rw [add_comm b c]` will not work on a goal
of the form `a + b + c = a + c + b`, as `a + b + c` actually
means `(a + b) + c`, so again the brackets are in the wrong place.

However, associativity (which moves brackets around) and commutativity
(which swaps variables around) can in theory be used to prove goals
like `(d + f) + (h + (a + c)) + (g + e + b) = a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h`.
Let's start with a simpler one. Can you do it in three rewrites?

Conclusion
"
If you have got this far, then you have become very good at
manipulating equalities in Lean. Now let's think about the
annoying level `a + b + c + d = a + c + d + b` and try and come
up with an *algorithm* which will solve this problem for us,
so we don't have to write `rw [add_assoc]` five times.
